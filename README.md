This is Harvard public course CS50 after-class solutions.
I'm very new to programming and my code looks silly that I know XD.

Lol late update for myself, I have never been assigned any tasks that has to be working in C but JavaScript/TypeScript all alone. Guess I would have to say goodbye to CS50 and this repo.

So it’s about time to get back finishing this course completely. It’s funny and interesting cause I never thought I would be doing C at my first job but it just happened.
Gonna need to review this course from the very beginning I guess. WOW I’ve missed this!

Postponed updating for a while as I am currently running out of time.
I've finished studying all the lectures today but won't be spending time solving 
pset-problems by now. 
I need to learn "job-orient" skills first so I'll jump into some web-programming courses
and put this one behind.
Will try to solve remained problems without pre-written code later this year if I got time.
Hope I can get a job as soon as possible.
